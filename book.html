        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project explores the use of AI and GIS technologies to assess and understand student perceptions of flood risks on university campuses. A web-based platform was developed to integrate and visualize flood-related data, empowering users to explore campus vulnerabilities and provide feedback on perceived risks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Data Collection and Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>We created a dataset of georeferenced maps, satellite imagery, street view images, flood maps, density maps, and digital elevation models (DEMs) from 30 Gulf of Mexico university campuses. Campuses with at least 80% street view coverage were included, resulting in a dataset of 675,486 images.</p>

        <h2>Web Interface Design</h2>
        <p>The web interface integrates macro-level data (e.g., satellite images) and micro-level data (e.g., street view images) to visualize flood risks. Features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remote sensing imagery and student surveys for comprehensive analysis.</li>
            <li>Interactive clustering using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM).</li>
            <li>Image categorization with Inception-ResNet-v2 for risk analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Workshop and Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>A two-day workshop with 205 participants gathered insights on campus flood risks. Feedback was analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Word clouds and heatmaps to identify common concerns.</li>
            <li>Analysis of risks such as falling trees and unsafe walking areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>Students identified significant risks, including falling trees, vehicle damage, and unsafe campus areas during floods. The insights highlight the need for targeted interventions and improved campus disaster preparedness.</p>
